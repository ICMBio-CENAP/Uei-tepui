abstract = {Non-flying mammals were surveyed by trapping and transect census at seven localities in Peru, Ecuador, and Brazil. Relative numbers of individuals of smaller species varied dramatically from site to site while those of large species tended to be quite constant. The observed pattern of variation in numbers of individuals is mirrored by species richness differences between western Amazonia and the Guiana Shield region of Brazil, suggesting that similar environmental factors may regulate both the numbers of individuals and species in a locality. Soil fertility and undergrowth density are positively correlated with the density and species richness of mammals in a locality, but quantity or pattern of rainfall does not seem to account for any of the observed differences. Competition, home range size and diet are discussed as possible causes of the differential reduction in density and species richness of small, compared to large species in unfavorable habitats. Hunting has extirpated or severely reduced populations of large mammals, especially primates, at five of the seven localities surveyed.},

@article{Hershkovitz1969,
abstract = {A major goal of research in ecology and evolution is to explain why species richness varies across habitats, regions, and clades. Recent reviews have argued that species richness patterns among regions and clades may be explained by “ecological limits” on diversity over time, which are said to offer an alternative explanation to those invoking speciation and extinction (diversification) and time. Further, it has been proposed that this hypothesis is best supported by failure to find a positive relationship between time (e.g., clade age) and species richness. Here, I critically review the evidence for these claims, and propose how we might better study the ecological and evolutionary origins of species richness patterns. In fact, ecological limits can only influence species richness in clades by influencing speciation and extinction, and so this new “alternative paradigm” is simply one facet of the traditional idea that ecology influences diversification. The only direct evidence for strict ecological limits on richness (i.e., constant diversity over time) is from the fossil record, but many studies cited as supporting this pattern do not, and there is evidence for increasing richness over time. Negative evidence for a relationship between clade age and richness among extant clades is not positive evidence for constant diversity over time, and many recent analyses finding no age-diversity relationship were biased to reach this conclusion. More comprehensive analyses strongly support a positive age-richness relationship. There is abundant evidence that both time and ecological influences on diversification rates are important drivers of both large-scale and small-scale species richness patterns. The major challenge for future studies is to understand the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms underpinning the relationships between time, dispersal, diversification, and species richness patterns},

abstract = {Information about the magnitude and geographic distribution of mammalian diversity in Neotropical lowland rainforests is important for evaluating research and conservation priorities in Central and South America. Although relevant inventory data are rapidly accumulating in the literature, real site-to-site diversity differences are hard to identify because many confounding factors can affect the size and composition of faunal lists. Herein we assess the available information about Neotropical rainforest mammal diversity and suggest guidelines for future work by reviewing inventory methods, documenting and discussing faunal lists from ten localities, and summarizing geographic range data to predict diversity patterns that can be tested by field and museum research. All inventory methods are biased because each is suitable for collecting or observing only a fraction of the morphologically and behaviorally diverse mammalian fauna that inhabits Neotropical rainforests. Hence, many methods must be used in combination to census whole communities. Although no combination of methods can be guaranteed to produce complete inventories, the omission or nonintensive application of any of several essential methods probably guarantees incomplete results. We recommend nine methods that, used intensively and in combination, should maximize the efficiency of future inventory fieldwork. Ten rainforest mammal inventories selected as exemplars illustrate several common problems: sampling effort is highly variable from study to study, species accumulation curves are not asymptotic for any fauna, essential field methods were omitted in every case, and some localities were partially defaunated by hunters prior to inventory. Meaningful diversity comparisons are therefore impossible without a major investment in additional fieldwork at each site. Geographic range data provide an essential alternative source of diversity estimates. Comparisons of inventory results with geographic expectations (diversity predictions based on range data) suggest that all existing inventories are incomplete, that the degree of incompleteness is inversely correlated with inventory duration, and that special methods are required to add elusive species to faunal lists. The range data at hand also suggest several geographic patterns that should be tested with carefully focussed fieldwork. (1) Mammalian diversity in Amazonia is probably greatest in the western subregion (between the Rio Negro and the Rio Madeira, where over 200 species might be sympatric at some localities), least in the Guiana subregion (east of the Negro and north of the Amazon), and intermediate in southeastern Amazonia (east of the Madeira and south of the Amazon). (2) Geographic variation in Amazonian diversity chiefly involves marsupials, bats, primates, and rodents; by contrast, xenarthran, carnivore, and ungulate faunas are remarkably uniform across the entire region. (3) In Central American rainforests, a conspicuous and apparently monotonic diversity gradient extends from eastern Panama (where mammalian diversity is within the range of Amazonian values) to southern Mexico (where mammalian diversity may be less than anywhere else on the rainforested Neotropical mainland). Mammalian diversity in coastal Venezuelan and southeastern Brazilian rainforests is difficult to assess with existing literature and collection resources, but neither region is likely to be as diverse as Amazonia. Despite a few dissenting voices, the literature of New World mammalogy provides compelling evidence that mammalian diversity, as measured by sympatric species richness, is greatest in lowland tropical rainforests and decreases along gradients of increasing latitude, elevation, and aridity. Thus, the mammalian faunas of western Amazonia are the most diverse of any in the Americas and perhaps in the world. We briefly discuss the generality and causes of observed diversity patterns in terms of contemporary ecology and historical scenarios. Significant advances in understanding mammalian diversity patterns in Neotropical rainforests will require systematic revisions of many problematic genera and an aggressive program to inventory poorly sampled areas while opportunities to do so yet remain.},

abstract = {During the flooding of a primary lowland rainforest at the Petit Saut electric dam in French Guiana, opossums of the genus Didelphis were caught in 89 localities dispersed over a surface of ca. 60 km(2) along the Sinnamary River. Based on external morphological characters such as ear colour and/or facial markings, 41 D. albiventris and 200 D. marsupialis were identified, measured, and released in a primary forest near the dam. Because the two species are morphologically so similar, some doubt on their identification remained for a few animals with intermediate phenotype. For 162 individuals, a skin biopsy was performed as a source of DNA for molecular species identification. By the combined use of two molecular probes, 31 D. albiventris and 129 D. marsupialis have been positively recognized, thus indicating that external morphology did correctly recognize 95% of individuals. Sixteen sampling localities revealed the syntopic presence of both species, extending the few previous observations suggesting that sympatry does occur in French Guiana. External measurements (head and body, tail-length, hind foot, and weight) indicate that the white-eared opossum D. albiventris is smaller than the black-eared D. marsupialis, although values overlap considerably. A combination of two measurements (hind foot; eye-muzzle distance) allows to specifically discriminate most individuals. The female reproductive activity was noted, and indicates that embryos and/or lactating females are observed during almost all months, but with half observations occurring between March and May. The average litter size is similar in both species. These data indicate that D. albiventris, although less abundant, does coexist in sympatry with D. marsupialis in Guianan lowland primary rainforest. Such an observation leads the premices of future ecological studies aimed at understanding how these two related taxa share their habitat in order to diminish interspecific competition.},

However, data collection has increased at a much faster rate than the development of tools to manage, process and analyse these data. Without these tools, wildlife managers and other stakeholders have little information to effectively manage, understand and monitor wildlife populations. We identify four barriers that are hindering the widespread use of camera trap data for conservation. We propose specific solutions to remove these barriers integrated in a modern technology platform called Wildlife Insights. We present an architecture for this platform and describe its main components. We recognize and discuss the potential risks of publishing shared biodiversity data and a framework to mitigate those risks. Finally, we discuss a strategy to ensure platforms like Wildlife Insights are sustainable and have an enduring impact on the conservation of wildlife.},

All known specimens were collected on sandstone table mountains (eroded fragments of the Roraima Formation) in the eastern subregion of Pantepui. The new species, M. pakaraimae, is one of only seven mammals known to be endemic to Pantepui, and phylogenetic analyses of cytochrome-b sequence data indicate that its sister taxon is M. parvidens, a geographically adjacent lowland species. Our results, together with those from phylogenetic studies of other Pantepui endemic mammals, suggest that at least some of these highland taxa evolved from lowland species in the late Cenozoic and are neither ancient relicts of tepui vicariance nor the descendents of long-distance-dispersing Andean progenitors. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Museum of Natural History.},

abstract = {We studied the taxonomy and biogeography of Mazama bricenii, a brocket deer classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN, drawing on qualitative and quantitative morphology and sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene. We used Ecological Niche Modeling (ENM) to evaluate the hypothesis that M. bricenii of the Venezuelan Cordillera de M{\'{e}}rida (CM) might have become isolated from populations of its putative sister species, Mazama rufina, in the Colombian Cordillera Oriental (CO). This hypothesis assumes that warm, dry climatic conditions in the T{\'{a}}chira Depression were unsuitable for the species. Our analyses did not reveal morphological differences between specimens geographically attributable to M. bricenii and M. rufina, and phylogenetic analyses of molecular data recovered M. bricenii nested within the diversity of M. rufina. These results indicate that M. bricenii should be regarded as a junior synonym of M. rufina. ENM analyses revealed the existence of suitable climatic conditions for M. rufina in the T{\'{a}}chira Depression during the last glacial maximum and even at present, suggesting that gene flow between populations in the CO and CM may have occurred until at least the beginning of the current interglacial period and may continue today. Because this pattern might characterize other mammals currently considered endemic to the CM, we examined which of these species match two criteria that we propose herein to estimate if they can be regarded as endemic to the CM with confidence: (1) that morphological or molecular evidence exists indicating that the putative endemic taxon is distinctive from congeneric populations in the CO; and (2) that the putative endemic taxon is restricted to either cloud forest or p{\'{a}}ramo, or both. Only Aepeomys reigi, Cryptotis meridensis, and Nasuella meridensis matched both criteria; hence, additional research is necessary to assess the true taxonomic status and distribution of the remaining species thought to be CM endemics.},

Principal component analysis was used to assess morphologic variation among the species of Nasua. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to determine whether there were any difference among the three taxa in any of the quantitative features measured and to determine whether the Cozumel coati was significantly smaller than N. narica of the Yucatan peninsula (including the Yucatan, Campeche, and Quintana Roo departments). Morphological features were examined to determine whether there were any qualitative features that could distinguish between any of the species of Nasua. Principal component analysis showed that N. nelsoni was not distinctly smaller in body size when compared to a series of mainland coatis. Mann-Whitney U tests revealed significant differences between N. nasua and N. narica (P < 0.01) is most quantitative features measured. Significant differences (P < 0.05) were found between Yucatan N. narica and N. nelsoni for 27 of the 32 quantitative features measured; however, when N. nelsoni was compared to a geographically representative sample of mainland N. narica, only 16 of the 32 features were significant (P < 0.05). Eight qualitative features, including features of the anterior alveolar foramen, nasal bones, postorbital process of the jugal bone, mesopterygoid region of the palate, m2 entoconid, baculum, nose color, and hair at the nape of the neck were found to separate N. nasua from N. narica and N. nelsoni. Differences in the quantitative analyses between N. nasua and N. narica and between N. nelsoni and N. narica are differences commonly seen at the subspecific level and are not considered of sufficient nature to recognize any of the taxa as distinct species based on these quantitative features. The qualitative features were found useful in separating N. nasua from N. narica. No qualitative features were found to separate N. nelsoni from N. narica. Based on results of this study, N. nelsoni should be considered conspecific with N. narica. Therefore, only two species of Nasua (N. nasua and N. narica) are recognized.},

Despite this, ecological information on the species, including its biological interactions and habitat use, is scarce, especially for the Andes. In some regions, Nasua nasua is sympatric with other closely related species of the Procyonidae family, including the mountain coati Nasuella olivacea. Here, we assess the influence of environmental and anthropogenic factors on the occupancy of these two species and the spatial and temporal bases of their co-occurrence along an elevational gradient. Camera trapping (with 85 camera-trap stations) was conducted during the dry season of 2016 along elevations from 1600 to 3600 m above sea level (m. a. s. l.) in northern Peru. We observed a total of 244 detections for Nasua nasua and 17 for Nasuella olivacea over 9457 cumulative camera-days. Occupancy modelling (Royle-Nichols model) showed that Nasua nasua occupancy was significantly and negatively related to elevation but positively related to forest cover. In contrast, Nasuella olivacea occupancy was significantly and positively related to elevation. In addition, Nasuella olivacea was detected in only 5 of the 45 total sites occupied by Nasua nasua; therefore, spatial overlap was low. Consequently, co-occurrence modelling based on a Bayesian approach showed no evidence of avoidance between the two coati species. Additionally, activity patterns suggest low levels of temporal overlap; however, we consider this a preliminary finding due to the limited number of detections for Nasuella olivacea. Our results not only increase the understanding of the ecology of both Nasua nasua and Nasuella olivacea but also provide information towards their conservation in this part of their distribution range.},

abstract = {The procyonid taxon Nasuella Hollister, 1915, is currently recognized as a monotypic genus comprising the single species N. olivacea (Gray, 1865), the Mountain Coati, found in montane habitats (circa 1300-4250 m) in the Andes of Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador. In this study we utilize museum specimens to examine the phylogenetic relationships, taxonomy and geographic distribution of Nasuella populations with an integrative systematic approach. Drawing on morphological comparisons of pelage, cranial, and dental characters, and molecular comparisons of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b (from recent and historical samples), we confirm that Nasuella is closely related to other coatis (Nasua) and show that there are two deeply divergent lineages represented within the taxonomic bounds of Nasuella. We recognize and diagnose these taxa as two distinctive mountain coati species, corresponding to the Eastern Mountain Coati Nasuella meridensis (Thomas, 1901), endemic to the Venezuelan Andes, and the Western Mountain Coati N. olivacea, distributed in the Andes of Colombia and Ecuador. We use locality and habitat data associated with museum specimens to model the global geographic range of both species. From this we predict areas of undocumented (i.e., currently unvouchered) occurrence, areas of habitat loss associated with land use changes, and the geographic barrier separating the distributions of N. meridensis and N. olivacea. This newfound understanding of taxonomy and distribution should allow for a revised conservation assessment for mountain coatis.

@article{Brown2001,
abstract = {The four major papers in this special feature present and interpret data from field studies on the distributions and diversity of small mammals in elevational gradients on mountains in the Philippines, Borneo, southern Mexico and western United States. In the introductory paper, Lomolino places these studies in the context of historical, methodological and conceptual themes in contemporary biogeography. In this final paper, I focus on some important similarities and interesting differences among the four case studies. All of the studies provide evidence for the influence of ecological factors, such as climate, productivity and habitat heterogeneity, on mammalian diversity. All also provide evidence for the influence of historical dispersal, extinction, and speciation events. Perhaps the most interesting result is the documentation of a frequent, but not universal, peak in species diversity at some elevation intermediate between the base and peak of a mountain. Efforts to understand the mechanistic basis for this pattern - and why it differs from the continuous decrease in diversity from the equator to the poles - promise to contribute to developing a general theoretical explanation for the major patterns of biodiversity on earth.},

@article{Ochoa1993,
abstract = {A study on the communities of mammals of Caimana national Park, in terms of their taxonomic structures, trophic compositions and potential sensitivities, is presented. The analysis embraces six ecological units: lowland forests, montane forests, shrublands, savannas, sub-tepui grasslands, and highland vegetation in tepuis. In addition, a checklist of the mammals recorded in the Venezuelan Guia is given. This list includes 236 species 75% of all known taxa of the country), of which 62 have their distributions restricted to this region and six are endemic. At least 210 species are estimated to inhabit Caima national Park 118 with records and 92 whose presence is expected). In this national park, communities of lowland and montane forests show the highest values of taxonomic diversity and trophic complexity. the most important groups in these ecosystems are Chiroptera, Rodentia, Carnivora and Marsupiala, with a high number of taxa being insectivores, frugivores, and omnivores. In savannas, sub-tepui grasslands and highland vegetation in tepuis, the communities of mammals show a reduction in their taxonomic diversity and trophic composition. the most common orders there are Chiroptera, Rodentia, and Carnivora, with a high proportion of herbivores, insectivores and omnivores. the highest sensitivity was estimated for those communities inhabiting tepui summits, while savannas and sub-tepui grasslands showed the lowest values. Filly, some issues related with the conservation of mammals in the Guiana Region of Venezuela are discussed.},

@incollection{Rull2019,
abstract = {This chapter is an introductory synthesis of the concept of Pantepui and its characterization as a biogeographical province of the Guiana region in the Neotropical realm. The term “Pantepui” originated in the late 1960s as an informal name to designate the special avifauna inhabiting the summits of the table mountains characteristic of the Guiana Highlands: the tepuis. Three decades later, Pantepui was formally defined as a biogeographical unit based on physiographic, environmental, and phytogeographical criteria. In this currently accepted definition, the Pantepui province is a fragmented area of c. 5000 km2 formed by the tepui summits between 1200/1500 m and c. 3000 m elevation under mesothermic/submicrothermic ombrophilous climates. From a biotic point of view, Pantepui harbors a peculiar, notably rich, and highly endemic flora that develops unique plant communities not found anywhere else. The richness of the Pantepui flora falls within the more biodiverse areas worldwide, and its degree of endemism resembles that of oceanic islands. Pantepui has been subdivided into four phytogeographical districts: Eastern (two subdistricts), Jaua-Duida (three subdistricts), Western (three subdistricts), and Southern. From a zoogeographical point of view, several Pantepui definitions have been suggested, but a formal unified description and characterization are lacking. It is hoped that existing and future zoogeographical studies will help refine and enrich the Pantepui concept as a comprehensive biogeographical unit.},
